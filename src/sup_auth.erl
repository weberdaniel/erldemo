%% @doc This is the initialization function of the supervisor process. It
%%      defines how often the auth process itself can be restarted during
%%      which Time interval. It defines which process shall be supervised
%%      ( auth ) and how it shall be initialized ("start_link") also what
%%      argument shall be used for initialization ("auth_testfile3").
%%

  % the restart strategy is one_for_one, this means that exaclty one
  % process will replace another process. The process shall be a 
  % permanent process and it is of type worker process.
